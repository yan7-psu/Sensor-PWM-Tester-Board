# Sensor/PWM Tester Board.

This is the PCB I worked on from September 2023 - May 2024 @ PSU's PGE Foundation Power Engineering Education Laboratory under Dr. Mahima Gupta.
It was built using Altium Designer.

This PCB provides support for 4 Voltage Sensors, 5 Current Sensors, 6 PWM outputs and 1 Motor sensor(Speed/Torque).
The PCB allows a development board to be directly connected. It supports TI's LAUNCHXL-F280049C and LAUNCHXL-F28379D.

This PCB was used for Daisy Delgado-Zaragoza's master dissertation: [A Buck-Boost Current-Controlled Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive with Stiff Motor Terminal Voltage and Current Waveforms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10860890/metrics#metrics)
